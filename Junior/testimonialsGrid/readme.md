# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Tried to code it purely in flex-box to challenge myself (since I don't use it often). Found a use for both the min and max width. Very pleased with the background-position code, I'm getting better at using it.

Problems: Only problem was trying to get the Kira's card to line up right. Ended up having to make two different divs to wrap around Kira's card and everyone else's card. I also wanted to use more pseudo-classes to test myself, but I had to ditch some (for the articles), because it was getting too messy.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty was easy, upped the font size because that's way too tiny for my eyes.
