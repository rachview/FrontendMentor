        <div class="article-btm">“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
          course
          and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling
          -
          time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
          Engineer
          at a VR startup.”</div>

          The

        <div class="article-mid">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</div>
        <div class="article-btm">“Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
          structure
          from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend!”</div>
