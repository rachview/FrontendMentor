Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, SASS, JS, Vite/NPM.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto SASS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Followed it up with JS. Used Vite to compile SASS.

Problems: SASS takes a lot of setting up, but I can see it be better as a library rather than starting fresh each time. JS was a little troublesome until I moved the 'nav-is-open' class into the body tag, after that it worked fine.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty is only hard because of SASS, the structure of the files will take much getting use to. Credit to CoderCoder for Sass help: https://youtu.be/jfMHA8SqUL4 and Kevin Powell: https://youtu.be/dRuMoGNcJfw (bit older but I wouldn't of gotten the nav without his videos.)
