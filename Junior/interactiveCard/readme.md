# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive card details form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS, JS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Followed it up with JS for the form and credit card input.

Problems: The JS for this was very complex, and stretched me. I watched several tutorials trying to figure it out. Including both Irvine Mesa: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPmrpEVzm2Y and Florin Pop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsd4FNGTRBw (used this as a skeleton). The validation could be better, but I'm pleased for a first go. The hardest part was trying to get the credit cards to look right with CSS, made three attempts before I settled for this one.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty was hard, but rewarding. I'm most pleased with the linear-gradient border that I found online from: https://codyhouse.co/nuggets/css-gradient-borders. Regex is very complex, found a link to this: https://regex101.com/r/yk0om0/1 for the credit card regex.
