# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component solution

This is a solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML, JSON, Chart.js, SASS, Vite/NPM.

In detail: Wrote in HTML, moved onto SASS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used Vite to compile SASS.

Problems: Worked in an older version of Chart.js, then had to update to a newer version--I wanted border-radius options. Trying to figure out how to change the options of the chart was the hardest part. Had to learn how to import JSON files into JS. Used Borislav Hadzhiev's solution: https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-import-json-file.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty was hard, watched a lot of Youtube videos and researched Stack Overflow solutions for Chart.js's layouts. David Gray's JS tutorial helped for understanding map method: https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode.
