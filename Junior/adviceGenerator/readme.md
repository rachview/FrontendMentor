# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: React, SASS, Vite/NPM.

In detail: Wrote in React, moved onto SASS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used Vite to compile SASS.

Problems: Still getting use to Sass. Hardest part was trying to get the button to be center with a position: absolute. Found a FreeCodeCamp article with a solution: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-an-absolute-positioned-element/. React was pretty easy since there was only one section for this design.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty hard, but rewarding. Watched tsbsankara's tutorial to learn how to import an API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wo_rj2dhkw
