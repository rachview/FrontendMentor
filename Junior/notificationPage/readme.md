# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution

This is a solution to the [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS, JS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Followed it up with JS to manipulate the HTML elements, using foreach to both sum the elements, and operate the click events.

Problems: For this one the JS was easier than the layout. I ended up writing the notification elements three times before I got one that worked for every single element. Found it easier to write for Kimberly and then Rizky's css styles, and then just removing the message and image for the others.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty was hard, but glad that JS is getting a little easier.
