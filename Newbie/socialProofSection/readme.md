Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a social proof section solution. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used display grid and display flex. Media query adjusting transformation of rating and testimonial divs. Used two divs with absolute positing for the svg background images, these were very hard to see on the reference--so I guessed on placement.

Problems: Mobile was easy, but getting the divs to behave on desktop was difficult. Had to use transform and translateY and translateX.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty hard.
