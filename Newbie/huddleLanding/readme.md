Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a landing page for Huddle. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used display grid and a little display flex for layout adjustments.

Problems: Desktop version gave me trouble trying to figure out the grid-template-areas (kept losing the image). Needed 3 columns instead of the 2 I wanted.

Final Thoughts: Display grid still puzzles me, having to look up tutorials. I like how organized this one felt, less thrown together.
