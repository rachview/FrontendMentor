Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS, JS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used JS to toggle the "hidden" attribute on and off.

Problems: The only hard part was trying to figure out how to do the button in JS, watched tsbsankara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09wN4Rp9EGk for help. The images are very had to tell where certain colors are.

Final Thoughts: Using regex is difficult.
