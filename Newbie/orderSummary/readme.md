# Order Summary Card

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create an order summary card. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used display grid. Used background-images in the body. Used css variables to make the design easier. Finally, used a combination of buttons and links.

Problems: Getting the background-image to line up correctly, had to fiddle with the position, and size. Had to change the Proceed Button to a button (was a link), in order to have a box shadow.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty was easy. Added a transition for fun and changed the box shadow of the Proceed Button for an animation.
