# Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a rating card. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS, JS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used display grid and a little display flex for layout adjustments. Then worked on JS (which was really hard) and required a lot of searching the internet for help.

Problems: The hardest problem was trying to get the "thank you card" to update with the rating. After that, I had trouble trying to set up an if-statement to check for empty strings.

Final Thoughts: Need to learn way more Javascript. Html and CSS easy. Never would have figured out radio buttons without dcode (had the input and label reversed, and I didn't know how to get the checked state): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDh9uToZkYg
