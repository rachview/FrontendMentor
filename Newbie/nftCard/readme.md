# NFT Preview Card

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a nft card. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.
In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop (didn't need desktop media query). Used display grid to keep everything in the center, forgoing the need for a media query. Used display flex, css variables, pseudo-elements, called two classes at once.

Problems: The overlay for the image container, I tried to use background-blend-mode but that didn't work, so I lowered the transparency on the cyan. Took a minute to implement the eye icon, realized I could just hide the element and make it visible on hover. This required calling it on the hover state of the container-image class.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty took some effort. Most pleased with my solution for the overlay of the eye-icon.
