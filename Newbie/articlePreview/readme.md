# Article preview component solution

This is a solution to the [Article preview component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create an article preview component. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS, JS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used JS to toggle divs and images.

Problems: I would write up the HTML differently so that this wouldn't cause so many problems with Javascript.

Final Thoughts: Harder than it looks. Never would of figured out the Javascript if not for Marko Ilic: https://css-tricks.com/working-with-javascript-media-queries/

# Verison 1.1: index1.html (style1.css, and index1.js)

Redid the design project and built the JS early (after I redid the mobile) and simplified it. Used the CSS in order to transform the share element, making WAY-WAY easier (getting rid of the extra divs). Also, I copied the SVG directly into the HTML worked way better for adjusting the style of the button.
