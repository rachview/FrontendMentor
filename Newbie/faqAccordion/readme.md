Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create an FAQ accordion card. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS, JS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used JS to toggle divs.

Problems: The hardest part was not the JS, but trying to get the desktop version to hide one image while fully display another, ended up using a clip-path. Also trying to get the background images to line up correctly. Originally had the accordion operate with buttons, but I decided to make a question-wrapper class seeing as the active class had hover effect.

Final Thoughts: My favorite part was using the clip-path, didn't know I could use it for such things. Credit to John Smilda's (Coding Addict on Youtube) Built 15 JavaScript Projects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4. Forewent the svg chevrons supplied, for Font Awesome icons chevrons.
