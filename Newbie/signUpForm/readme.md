Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS, JS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked desktop to mobile.

Problems: The javascript for this one is rough, watched several tutorials on how to do it but I couldn't get it to work (perhaps will revisit this later). Followed Programming's Fun video for the script: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yag59U7ESRE

Final Thoughts: Difficulty the javascript was hard as usual, but I did find out that there is a pseduo class for invalid inputs.
