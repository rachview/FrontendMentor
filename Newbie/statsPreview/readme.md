# Stats Preview Card

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a stats preview card. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop (didn't need desktop media query). Used display grid and display flex. Media query for the image, and adjusting the flex display. Used css variables to make the design easier.

Problems: It took some work to get the card to look right on desktop, but adjusting the width of the "container-body" class fixed it. Hard to determine the font families by the design, a bit too alike.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty easy. Finally got to use the flex-flow: row-reverse for the first time ever. Yeah.
