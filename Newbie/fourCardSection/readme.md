Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a four card featured section. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked desktop to mobile--it was easier to figure out how to create the grid. Used display grid for the cards. Used display flex for layout adjustments.

Problems: Trying to get the two middle cards to be close together. Used transform: translateY to bring the two cards closer.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty took some effort, found it easier to work desktop to mobile for this one. Added a middle tier for tablets just because I didn't like how the cards folded in on themselves.
