# QR Code Component Card

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a qr-code card. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop (didn't need desktop media query). Used display grid to keep everything in the center, forgoing the need for a media query. Used css variables to make the design easier.

Problems: Had to fiddle with letter spacing (tried max-width first) to get the text to break like the design card.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty was very easy.
