This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Credit: All images and designs were provided by FrontEnd Mentor.

Task: Follow the design created by FrontEnd Mentor to create a card. Keep it as close to the design as possible, and using the styles they have chosen.

What was used: HTML 5, CSS.

In detail: Wrote HTML code, moved onto CSS code, and worked mobile to desktop. Used both display flex and display grid. Used background-images to design the image container. Used css variables to make the design easier.

Problems: Ran into some difficulty trying to get the desktop format, but nothing a grid didn't fix. Getting the font to break right also took some work, originally used a <br> until I saw the desktop view--deleted it. Then I adjusted the padding and font-size until it looked passable. Could have used more css variables to avoid sloppy code and speed up time.

Final Thoughts: Difficulty was easy. I enjoyed trying to code without the Figma file and guessing at what the values.
